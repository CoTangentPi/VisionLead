## Recomended videos

I found the following series of videos, which does a really good job of introducing how to work with Zephyros,
explaining things in a way that is easy to understand. It's based on the esp32, but the information can be applied
to our board with some digging around through the files. There are 6 videos in total

For reference, the main device tree for our board is located in zephyr/dts/nordic/nrf52840
